# Comprehensive-banking-analytics

# Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to leverage advanced data analytics techniques, including classification, regression, and clustering, to extract valuable insights and enhance decision-making processes within the banking sector.


The project aims to address various aspects of banking operations, such as customer segmentation, credit risk assessment, and performance prediction.


This  project aims to demonstrate the power of advanced analytics in optimizing various facets of banking operations, ultimately contributing to the overall success and sustainability of the financial institution

# Approach: 

Customer Segmentation (Clustering): 

  Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on their banking behaviours, transaction histories, and demographics. 

Credit Risk Assessment (Classification): 

  1.Develop a robust credit scoring system using classification algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants. 

  
  2.Utilize historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default or late payments. 

  
  3.Enhance risk management by integrating machine learning models into the credit approval process. 

Performance Prediction (Regression): 

  1.Build regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution, such as asset growth, revenue, and profitability. 

  
  2.Analyze the impact of various factors, such as economic indicators and market trends, on the bank's performance. 
  
  3.Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, investment strategies, and overall business performance.
